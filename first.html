<p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet <b>consectetur </b>adipisicing elit. Id, dicta! Id error fugit cumque. 
    Quae fuga repellendus nam doloribus modi assumenda <i>praesentium </i>dolores quod vero similique, asperiores voluptatem fugiat quidem.
    The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no space <u>between</u> words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions).
     Over time, text direction (left to right) became <del>standardized</del><ins> perfect</ins>. Word dividers and terminal punctuation became common. 
     The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos, similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.
     The Greek parágraphos <s>evolved </s>into the pilcrow (¶), which in <mark>English</mark> manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences.
     Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line breaks (newline) followed by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. 
     An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text.H<sub>2</sub>OThis style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. 
     Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[2] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. 
     This style can be seen in the (handwritten).H<sup>2</sup>O United States Constitution from 1787.
     For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.</p>
